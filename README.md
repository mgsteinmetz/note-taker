## Description
This is a Note Taker that allows a user to save anything they want! The notes are saved by recreating them as JSON objects! 

You can VIEW my deployed site here: [Note-Taker](https://murmuring-refuge-68595.herokuapp.com/) . From here you can save as many notes as you like!

## Installation
If you would like to INSTALL my code instead, travel to my github, clone my repository, and use my code! 

## Usage 
To USE my code, all you have to do is type 'node server.js' into the integrated terminal!! This will create a live server, where you can then use any kind of API client. I often use [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) !

Below you can see what my deployed site looks like!

This is where you can save any note you want! When you are finished typing a save button will show up in the top right corner next to the add button!
